# Streamflow Forecasting Assignment 2

## Overview
You will produce a 1-week streamflow forecast for the Verde River near Camp Verde, AZ. You'll use your existing knowledge of python and associated libraries to access and analyze streamflow/meteorological data, and perform numerical/statistical analysis to develop your forecast. This assignment is testing your ability to synthesize the skills you've learned in this course to work with real world data and build workflows to analyze it and make predictions.

This assignment will be due on November 25th, 2024, @ 11:59pm. As such, your forecast should be for the period of November 25th - December 2nd (2024). Your forecast should be given as a single value for the forecast period as the average streamflow in cubic feet per second (cfs). The forecast code should produce the standard report as output and you should include the forecast output in your report as it is generated verbatim.


## Forecasting method
For this assignment I would like you to use a combination of the persistence and climatology methods to develop a 1-week streamflow forecast. This method will involve:
 - Using provided python modules and functions to access and summarize data
 - Develop methods to calculate the forecast, using the templates and documentation provided


## Assignment Details

This assignment is your second opportunity to build an analysis from scratch, with minimal starter code provided (though you should use code we have seen in class). You will need to:

- Develop a command line interface (CLI) to run your forecast code.
- Use python scripts and modules to organize your code.
- Retrieve historical streamflow and meteorological data using APIs.
- Develop a streamflow forecast using climatology methods.
- Write a short report explaining your methodology, code structure, and forecast results.

## Rubric
- Data Retrieval/Analysis (25%):
    - Pulling correct streamflow and meteorological data
    - Code is written in a modular and organized way
- Code Organization (25%):
    - Use of python scripts and modules to organize code
    - Use of a CLI to run the forecast code
- Code Functionality (25%)
    - Code runs without errors
    - Forecast is calculated correctly
    - Code can be re-run for different forecast locations **(HWRS 501 students only)**
- Report (25%)
    - Clear explanation of methodology and findings in plain language
    - Thoughtful discussion of forecast results
    - Suggestions for improving the codebase to make it more flexible or efficient
    - Incorporate additional printout information to make quantitative adjustments the final forecast quantities **(HWRS 501 students only)**
